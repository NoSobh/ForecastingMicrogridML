# Forecasting in Microgrids using Machine Learning
Forecasting Demand &amp; Supply in a renewable energy microgrid: Using Machine Learning models: LSTM (Long short-term memory), GRU (Gated recurrent unit) &amp; RNN (Recurrent neural network). The data is real-world, sourced from the Green Energy Park in Brussels. Used shallow architecture but can be edited for deep learning.

## Data Exploration

Note that the notebooks have additional exploration techniques such as Rolling Average, Differencing, Normal Distributio, Scatter Plots and other useful diagrams. Each gives insight into the chosen model architecture.
